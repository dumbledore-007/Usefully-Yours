Project Description
"Uselessly Yours"  is a fun web app that lets users create,  and explore hilarious blogs. It features AI humor analysis, multiple comedy categories, and a bad-word filter to keep the laughs safe and clean. A lighthearted platform built to spread smiles online.

In todayâ€™s world, people write funny stuff onlineâ€¦ but nobody measures just how funny it really is.
