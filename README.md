Welcome to You, Fully Yours  our intelligent blog prediction and humor analysis website.
First, we start by entering a topic into the input box. This could be anything you want a creative or humorous take on. Once we enter the topic, our system instantly generates a unique blog post based on it.
Next, we can refine the tone of the blog using our style options  for example, â€˜Witty & Sillyâ€™ or 'meme worthy'. These allow users to control the humor level and style of their generated content.
Within seconds, the website displays a fully written blog along with a humor percentage score, showing just how funny the generated post is.
Itâ€™s quick, simple, and fun  turning any idea into an engaging and shareable piece of writing.
